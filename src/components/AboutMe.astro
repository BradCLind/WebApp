      <p>
        Hi, I'm Brad, a software development student at NAIT in Edmonton, Alberta. I'm working toward my DMIT diploma (graduating December 2026).
        <br />
        My primary areas of interest:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>Full-stack development fundamentals</li>
        <li>Database design and implementation</li>
        <li>Object-oriented programming</li>
        <li>Web technologies and frameworks</li>
        <li>Software development methodologies</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p class="text-sm font-light">
      Beyond coding, I'm deeply interested in systems thinking, philosophy, and the intersection of technology with human consciousness and coordination. I spend considerable time exploring complex ideas through writing and introspective work, often using AI as a tool for articulating insights that exist beyond my usual conceptual frameworks.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm font-light">
      I'm in my mid-30s with a background in manual labor and team leadership, currently navigating a career transition into software development. I have a wife and two daughters, and I approach both learning and life with a strong empirical orientation—I'm interested in what actually works, not just what should work in theory.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm font-light">
      My goal is to bring the same coordination skills and systems awareness that helped me advance quickly in previous roles into software development, while staying grounded in direct experience rather than getting lost in abstractions.
